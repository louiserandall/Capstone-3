Data Analysis

You will be doing EDA on a movies dataset. To do this, you will need to:
- Load the dataframe in
- Clean the data
- Remove duplicate rows
- Discard entries with a zero movie budget
- Manipulate certain columns to the correct data type
- Answer the questions about the data

Follow these instructions clearly and use the EDA_doc file as a template for
creating a report to explain your visualisations, investigations and findings.


Re-create what you did in the above, but for the automobile dataset.
Create another report called automobile_eda.odt using EDA_doc as a template.
Follow the same steps as you did in the above.
